Please note that there is an installer on my site which will do all of this for you:

http://www.pretentiousname.com/adobe_pdf_x64_fix/index.html

These instructions are provided for people who would rather install by hand
or wish to automate the installation.

*** 32-bit users: See notes at the bottom. ***

There should be three files:

	Thumbridge.exe
	Thumbridge32.dll
	Thumbridge64.dll

Copy all three to:

	C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe Reader 64-bit fixes
	
You may use a different location if you wish, but it must be visible to 32-bit code.

In particular, do NOT use "C:\Program Files".

You then need to register the three files. Register the EXE first:

	Thumbridge.exe /regserver
	
Then register the two DLLs:

	regsvr32.exe /s Thumbridge32.dll
	regsvr32.exe /s Thumbridge64.dll

To UNINSTALL:

	Thumbridge.exe /unregserver
	regsvr32.exe /u /s Thumbridge32.dll
	regsvr32.exe /u /s Thumbridge64.dll

and then delete the files.


*** 32-bit users: ***

  You may want to install the thumbnail bridge on 32-bit machines as well,
  just to get rid of the white border that Adobe Reader puts around thumbnails.

  To do that, the steps are the same as above except that you can/should use
  "C:\Program Files" and you should ignore the Thumbridge64.dll file.
