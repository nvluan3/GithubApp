Description
===========
Symantec pcANYWHERE has 2 different types of passwords:

1. For all types of items: pcANYWHERE allows you to protect an item with a password (in "Protect item" tab). If an item is protected with a password, pcANYWHERE doesn't allow you modify or view the item's properties (depending on what you choose in the protection options). 

2. In remote control items and caller items: pcANYWHERE saves the login name and password details, for using them during the remote control sessions.

This utility can recover instantly both types of passwords.
