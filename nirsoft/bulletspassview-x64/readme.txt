Description
===========

BulletsPassView is a password recovery tool that reveals the passwords
stored behind the bullets in the standard password text-box of Windows
operating system and Internet Explorer Web browser. After revealing the
passwords, you can easily copy them to the clipboard or save them into
text/html/csv/xml file.


BulletsPassView is the successor of the old 'Asterisk Logger' utility,
with some advantages over the older tool:
* BulletsPassView doesn't reveal the password inside the password
  text-box itself. The password is only displayed in the main window of
  BulletsPassView, while the password text-box continues to display
  bullets.
* BulletsPassView also supports Windows 7/Vista/2008, while Asterisk
  Logger failed to work in these new operating systems.
* BulletsPassView also reveals the passwords stored in the password
  text-box of Internet Explorer.
* BulletsPassView supports command-line options to save the current
  opened password boxes into text/html/csv/xml file.
* BulletsPassView is a unicode application, which insures that
  passwords with non-English characters will be extracted properly.




Versions History
================


* Version 1.32:
  o Added 'Run As Administrator' option (Ctrl+F11), which allows you
    to easily run BulletsPassView as administrator on Windows
    Vista/7/8/2008. You should use this option is the software that has a
    password text-box is executed as administrator.
  o Fixed bug: BulletsPassView failed to remember the last
    size/position of the main window if it was not located in the primary
    monitor.

and up to Windows 7/2008. If you want to extract passwords from x64
application, you have to use the x64 version of BulletsPassView.



Know Limitations
================

This utility works fine with most password text-boxes, but there are some
applications that don't store the password behind the bullets, in order
to increase their security. In such cases, BulletsPassView will not be
able to reveal the password.
Here's some examples for applications that BulletsPassView cannot reveal
their passwords:
* Chrome, Firefox, and Opera Web browsers.
* Dialup and network passwords of Windows.

it'll be displayed on the main window. In order to make another scan,
simply choose 'Refresh' under the view menu or press F5. There is also
'Auto Refresh' option under the Options menu. If you turn it on,
BulletsPassView will automatically scan for new password text-boxes every
